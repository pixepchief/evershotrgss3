# Evershot
## 👋 | Welcome
Hello everyone. If you're reading this you most likely have access to beta-test the game (or if you're kind enough, bug test it for me). Evershot needs no introductions; it's a simple game made from a simple hobby of mine.

## **😄 | Features so far**
Evershot has quite a lot of features as of now, that includes;

🔨 Working Battle System

❤️️ Relationships, becoming friends or romancing others

📦 Crafting System


## **⚡ | Download**
You may download the game versions for bug testing and beta testing in the releases tab.
You **are not allowed** to distribute these copies of the game to people that I do not trust/people that I haven't given permission to play the game.
Thank you!


**This is an unfinished version of a cancelled game named Evershot which was intentionally cancelled for an ARG called Monophobia 1. It has been solved and the game is fully released with a walkthrough in my other repositories.**
